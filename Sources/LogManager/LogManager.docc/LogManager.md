# ``LogManager``

LogManager is a simple library to make it easier to add pretty debugging logging entries to an App project. 

## Overview

The library is broken into two main parts: 
* `Debug` - Use the static **Debug** class when you only want the comments to be printed when the app is compiled for **Debug**.
* `Log` - Use the static **Log** class when you want the comments to be printed for both the **Debug** and **Release** versions of the app.
